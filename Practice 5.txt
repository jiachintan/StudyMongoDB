Practice 5

1. $elemMatch
 match documents that contain an element in an array field

2. Best practice for securing access to MongoDB Atlas cluster
enable network peering and IP whitelisting

3. Best practice for secure communication
using SSL/TLS encryption for network communication

4. anti-pattern
Over-normalizing data to reduce the chances of data inconsistencies. 

5. mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority

mongodb+srv: define the protocol that will be used to connect to the MongoDB database.
cluster0.mongodb.net is the host, or server
myFirstDatabase is the database

6. The Attribute Pattern 
    ...
    release_USA: ISODate("2017-04-09T01:00:00+01:00"),
    release_France: ISODate("2017-04-09T01:00:00+01:00"),
    release_Italy: ISODate("2017-08-17T01:00:00+01:00"),
    ...

7. Sharding 
used by MongoDB to ensure high scalability

8. db.collection.createIndex({field1: 1, field2: 1})
create an index on multiple fields in MongoDB

9. snapshot
read concern levels should be used in conjunction with causal consistency to ensure session consistency

10. embedded relationship
Advantages: improved query performance, reduced need for joins, and increased maintainability. 

Disadvantages: limited size of documents, increased complexity of updates to related entities, and decreased scalability. 

11. Sharding the data across multiple servers.
best practice for managing data growth in MongoDB.

12. db.routes.getIndexes() 
isplay all indexes in a MongoDB collection. 

13. db.collection.find()
find all documents in a collection named "customers"

14. anti-pattern
Using nested arrays to model hierarchical data.

15. mongodump
export data in BSON format

16. deletedCount
db.users.deleteMany({ age: { $lt: 18 }, status: "inactive" }).deletedCount
get the number of deleted documents

17.  Schema Versioning Pattern

keep multiple versions of a document, and those versions can have different fields for each version in your application.

update the current schema with additional fields without shutting down the system for this upgrade. 

18. deleteOne() 
 removes the document from all nodes in the replica set
deleteMany() 
 removes the document from the primary node only.
