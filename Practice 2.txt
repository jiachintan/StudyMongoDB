Practice 2

1. cursor.hint() 
force to use a specific index for a query.

2. cursor.explain()
obtain info about the query execution and optimization plan.

3. mongodb+srv://datascientist34:ta33w9r@xtr-187.srv.net/admin
username: datascientist34
ta33w9r: password
xtr-187.srv.net: address of deployment or cluster.

4. mongorestore : restore data from binary backup, add a collection store in BSON file to cluster.
mongodump: create a binary backup of data.
mongoimport: import data from JSON/CSV.
mongoexport: export data to JSON/CSV.

5. Multi-document transaction: ensure data consistency in high-concurrency situation.

6. Sharding: distribute data across multiple server.
used for horizontal scaling of write-heavy workload.

7. Secondary Read Preference: time-inensive aggregation can be offloaded to a secondary member of the replica set.

8. db.collection.getIndexes(): display the indexes on the collection:index name, key pattern, and other details.

9. Most efficient index
Equality fields first
Sort fields next
Range fields last

10. findAndModify, { new: true } option
ensures that the modified document is returned upon modification.


11. Change Streams: Real-time dashboard.
GridFS : Storing and retrieving large file such as image or audio

12. sortByCount
Group documents by a certain field and count the number of documents in each group, followed by sorting the results by count in descending order.

13. $out: output the results to a specific collection

14. { $sample: { size: 10 } }: randomly select 10 documents from a specific collection

15. number of documents in the collection
db.products.countDocuments()
db.products.find().count()

16. Each individual pipeline stage has a limit of 100MB of RAM.

17. Sharding is a process of distributing data across multiple machines

18. Replication is the process of maintaining multiple copies of the same data on different machines. 

19. db.movies.find({ $expr: { $gt: ["$imdb.votes", "$year"] } } )
dollar sign 
Without the dollar sign, MongoDB treats them as literal strings instead of field references.

20. $set: { "courses.$.grade": 95 }
The grade is nested within the courses array, the correct field path should be "courses.$.grade".

21. insertedIds
In MongoDB, to return the _id values for all inserted documents, you can chain the insertedIds property to the result of the insertMany() method.

22. $sortByCount
$group + $sort

23. $set: { score: { $inc: 1 }
$set operator with the $inc operator to increase its value.

24."type":"autocomplete", "tokenization":"edgeGram"
autocomplete index be defined to look for matches at the beginning of a word

25. MongoDB Compass
powerful GUI for querying, aggregating, and analyzing your MongoDB data in a visual environment.

26. MongoDB drivers handle the creation and management of indexes, improving query performance.
