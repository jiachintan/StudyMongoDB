Practice 6

1. Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability.
With multiple copies of data on different database servers, replication provides a level of fault tolerance against the loss of a single database server.

2. db.orders.find({}).forEach(printjson).
printjson argument ensures that each document is printed in a readable JSON format.

3. anti pattern 
Storing geospatial data as strings instead of as geospatial data types. 

4. 16 MB.
maximum size of a MongoDB document

5. listIndexes
view the indexes of collections within the database

6. projection document 
specify or restrict the fields to be returned in the query results. 

7. Schema validation 
ensures the presence of required fields and their data types within a document. 

8. Subset Pattern
retrieve a course and its ten most recent reviews.

9. db.companies.find( { $expr: { $eq: ['$name', '$twitter_username'] } } )

10. anti pattern
Using a flat collection to store hierarchical data. 

11.  data modeling in MongoDB
Embedded data model
Document data model
Key-value data model

12. Sharding in MongoDB involves splitting data horizontally across multiple servers, distributing load and storing data based on a shard key. 

13. Best practice for monitoring a MongoDB Atlas cluster 
Enabling Performance Advisor and Alerts in Atlas.

14. Connection pooling 
involves maintaining a "pool" of open database connections, which can be reused for multiple requests, improving performance. 

15. Anti pattern
Denormalizing data to reduce the number of update operations required to update related data. 

16. A MongoDB replica set improves read performance by enabling read operations to be distributed across multiple secondary nodes. However, read operations on secondary nodes may return stale data.

17. "Array" data type 
used to store a list of values with inconsistent data types.
