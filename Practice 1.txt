Practice 1
1. clusterAdmin
greater cluster management access.

2. Array
store multiple values for a single field in a document

3. BSON types
Array
ObjectId
String

4. Rules build query index
equality, sort, range

5. $cat /etc/mongod.conf
display MongoDB configuration file from the command line (Linux)

6. BSON:
Binary JSON
support more data type than JSON
contain metadata to describe a document/object

7. db.collection.find().explain()
- the index used by the chosen plan
- whether the sort stage was performed by index or perfomed in memory
- all stages that the query must go through with detailes about the time it takes, number of documents process and returned to the next stage in the pipeline.

8. db.runCommand(command) 
provides a helper to run specified database commands.

9. BSON
-faster to parse and lighter to store than JSON
-can view it in JSON
-support more data types than JSON

10. mongd
- default port is 27017
- localhost host 127.0.0.1
- default data directory /data/db

11. cursor.explain()
- get information about the query plan

12. Contraint impact data model
- RAM
- Network
- Security & Compliance

13. bulkwrite
No insertMany please.
db.sales.bulkWrite({
  insertOne: [
    { name: "Product A", quantity: 10 },
    { name: "Product B", quantity: 5 }
  ]
})
